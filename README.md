# vam_flight_validation
Fix to the flights validation for VAM + AdminLTE template.

Just throw these files inside vam main folder. 

Important note: Since I don't allow charter flights on my VA, this code was test only for VAMACARS reports. So if you face any issue, message me :)

PS: Comments section is not working, nevertheless the system set as the comment an automatic message "Validated by $Admin_name"
